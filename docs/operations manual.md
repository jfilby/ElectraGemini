# Operations Manual

## Batch

### Manually run the batch

To start the batch process manually:

In the server path run:
`. scripts/dev.sh`
or
`. scripts/production.sh`

Then go to the batch path and run:
`npm run ts-script`


### Auto/monitored script

This is the ideal way to run the batch.


## Setup

After install go to /admin/setup (this must be done as a logged-in admin user).

There are several options there to administer the project.
